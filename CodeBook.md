======================================

xtrain is the X_train data.
ytrain is the Y_train data.
strain is the subject_train data.

xtest is the X_test data.
ytest is the Y_test data.
stest is the subject_test data.

xtot combines xtrain and ytest.
ytot combines ytrain and ytest.
stot combines strain and stot.

xcut selects only the columns with data representings means or std (standard deviations)

tot combines all the variables.

avgtot shows the averages of all the other data sets.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

-tBodyAcc-XYZ
-tGravityAcc-XYZ
-tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
-tBodyGyro-XYZ
-tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
-tBodyAccMag
-tGravityAccMag
-tBodyAccJerkMag
-tBodyGyroMag
-tBodyGyroJerkMag
-fBodyAcc-XYZ
-fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
-fBodyGyro-XYZ
-fBodyAccMag
-fBodyAccJerkMag
-fBodyGyroMag
-fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

-mean(): Mean value
-std(): Standard deviation
